### **Not Complete, please do not use**
A [LeftWM](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm) workstation for [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org).

<!--
    ## Installation
    Install [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/). I make no guarentess on whther anything will work if you install leftite from an already existing Silverblue install. \n
    After installing, open a terminal and run
    ```bash
    rpm-ostree rebase --experimental ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/th3-s4lm0n/leftite
    ```
    After it is done reboot, and click the gear > leftwm. Then login. You should bne greeted by a black screen. Press Meta (windows) + shift + enter to bring up a terminal and type:
    ```bash
    leftos firstboot --free
    ```
    for the free software install, or
    ```bash
    leftos firstboot --nonfree
    ```
    for the nonfree software install. This does include telemtry, you have been warned.
    Then press Meta + shift + r to reload and you should be good to go!
